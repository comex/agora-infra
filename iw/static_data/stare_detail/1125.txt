In order to assist CotC Wes with his reconstruction of the Appeal of CFJ
1125, here's a repost of former CotC Blob's original distribution of the
Appeal of CFJ 1125 on Tue, 8 Jun 1999 14:35:02 +1000. 

This message is available from egroups.com: it is message 801 in the
agora-official archive. I agree that the search engine is not very
helpful, though: I searched for "CFJ 1125" and came up with no matches.

Judge's Arguments:  

Well, time is running short, so it's time to call 
the Court into session.  I hereby enter a judgement 
of TRUE. 

Reasoning: 

Issue 1 - "clear indication" 

First, I wish to express my thanks to all those who 
participated in the recent (and enjoyable) debate, 
for their assistance in helping me clarify my 
thoughts on this subject. 

Throughout the recent debate I had been focusing my 
attention on the definition of "clear" wrt R1483, and 
it seemed to me that it was a toss-up as to whether 
"clear" must apply to the entire message or only to 
the imbedded statement of intent to propose.  Ultimately, 
however, I was persuaded that this judgement hinged more  
upon the meaning of "indication". 

The message can be divided as follows:  A large amount of 
"irrelevant" material; a statement of intent to propose; 
the text of a potential proposal; a statement of intent 
to adopt two proposals Without Objection.  But is that 
extra material really irrelevant?  Since it was sent to 
the PF, we must evaluate it for significance wrt to Agora. 
And, indeed, it is significant for its intent to distract 
Players from reading the other parts of the message.  So 
it modifies all parts of the message, including the 
statement of intent to propose.  IMO then, it becomes an  
integral part of the "indication" which it renders obtuse 
and obscure.  As such it is not a "clear indication" as 
required by R1483. 

Issue 2 - Identity 

One other thing I noticed when reviewing the post is that 
nowhere in the message is any Player of Agora identified 
as the sender of the message or as the author of the 
portions relevant to Agora.  Even the archives still list 
the unknown "janet"-whatever as the author.  We only have 
Steve's word that it was e who sent it.  Now I don't doubt 
Steve's honesty in this regard, but I tend to think that 
this should not be sufficient to regard the message as legally 
having been sent by em.  We have often required Players 
in the past to present evidence (i.e. copies of messages 
with headers) that they have actually done something they 
claim to have done.  Currently in Agora, the messages and 
their headers are the only "physical" evidence we have 
available to us.  Consider the following scenarios: 

1.  I give my office-mate some text describing actions 
    significant to Agora and ask em to e-mail that text 
    to agora-business, using eir own account. 

2.  Blob comes by to visit me here in Boston, and while I 
    step out for a couple of minutes to use the facilities, 
    e sends a message to agora-business using my computer 
    which I have carelessly left logged on. 

Neither of the above leave any "physical" trace of who really 
sent the message to a-b.  It either requires relying on 
someone's word or establishing a consistent method of dealing 
with the issue of a message's source.  I think the latter 
serves the interest of the game better and so I will attempt 
to use the Courts to establish such a principle here. 

A message can be considered to have been sent by a given Player if 
and only if the message clearly identifies that Player as the 
author.  If the "sender" specified in the message header is one 
officially published by the Registrar, then that establishes the 
Player's identity definitively. 

The "spam" post fails this test and, in the opinion of this court, 
should be deemed not to have been sent by any Player, further 
establishing a reason to find a judgement of TRUE, not to mention 
having implications for the other actions attempted within 
this message.

Caller's Arguments:  

On Steve sent a message with the following headers to nomic-business: 
 
> Date: Fri, 16 Apr 1999 10:11:36 +1000  
> To: 0000,8000,0000agora-business@gecko.serc.rmit.edu.au   
> From: 0000,8000,0000janet9981@yahoo.com   
> Subject: Maximize your website's traffic!  

This message contained the following text, deliberately hidden among  
a piece of spam:  

> I hereby submit the following Proposal, entitled "An Object 
> Lesson" delimited by triple dashes, and request that it have an 
> Adoption Index of 4. --- Rule 1883 is repealed. A Power = 4 Rule 
> entitled "An  Object Lesson" is created with the following text: 
> "This Rule was inserted into the Ruleset to warn against the 
> dangers of, and to commemorate Steve's long and ultimately 
> successful battle against R1883 (Adoption of Proposals Without 
> Objection)."--- I hereby announce my intention to adopt "A 
> Separation of Powers" and "An Object Lesson" Without Objection.  

1483 states, in part:  

      A Proposal is created whenever a Proposing Entity delivers 
      some collection of text to the Public Forum with the clear 
      indication that that text is intended to become a Proposal.    

I argue that there was no "clear indication" that "An Object Lesson"  
was intended to become a Proposal. Common sense tells us that a  
message like this, hidden in a large body of unrelated text, is  
anything but a "clear indication", regardless of what the message  
itself says.   

Since "An Object Lesson" never became a Proposal, it could not be  
adopted Without Objection, and so Rule 1883 remains unrepealed.
